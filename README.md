# Electricity Load Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting electricity demand using historical load data.
Accurate load forecasting helps in power planning, cost optimization, and reliability.

## Objective
- Analyze historical electricity consumption data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build a baseline machine learning model for load prediction

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Workflow
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training and Evaluation
5. Performance Analysis

## Current Status
- EDA completed
- Baseline regression model implemented
- Further improvements in progress
## Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository due to size limitations.
## Future Improvements
- Time series models (ARIMA / advanced regression)
- Feature enhancement
- Model optimization
